,,25%,Market vision,,2.0,"COMPANY B provides a unified platform for ESG, Sustainability, EHS, Operational Risk and Stewardship program management, providing functional leaders with best practice workflow solutions that enable program excellence in addition to metric reporting and disclosure capabilities.  We look to partner with organizations that have a vision for operationalizing Sustainability and ESG practices and culture within their facilities and operational activities, modeled after our 25 years of experience in working with organizations to do the same with their EHS and Operational Risk programs.  In order for organizations to be successful and to be able to sustain these programs, they must move beyond reporting simply to satisfy stakeholder groups (internal and external) and, instead, unify cross-functional efforts and operational workflows through active engagement with every person in the enterprise via digital transformation and continuous process improvement.

COMPANY B's target market is mid-cap and large-cap COMPANY Anies with annual turnovers of $1-10B and $10B+ revenues respectively. While we have extensive experience serving a wide range of industries, our ideal subscriber tends to be industrial (manufacturing, heavy industry, pharmaceutical/healthcare, consumer products, etc.) with a fixed facility footprint.   Our target audience is EHS, Sustainability, or ESG leaders who have broad operational and cross-functional needs beyond Sustainability and ESG.  Our typical buyers include VP, SVP and C-suite roles with responsibility across Sustainability, ESG, EHS.  COMPANY B's unified sustainability, ESG, product stewardship, and risk and compliance solutions help address a market that are not interested in or may not have the resources for different platforms for each.  We have seen significant growth in the Asia/Pacific region and anticipate continued expansion in this region in addition to U.S. and Europe as the regulatory landscape drives mandatory climate disclosures in these regions.

By leveraging our 25 years of experience in helping oganizations operationalize Sustainability and ESG objectives through enterprise-wide employee engagement, organizations can build best practices and accountability into core processes.  Our subscriber base also tends to prioritize operational sustainability functions over financial analysis, external communications, or other ESG functions that typically sit with investor relations, finance, or marketing. And since our customers are usually higher in the supply chain, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving ESG metrics, and mitigiating sustainability-related risk are prioritized to demonstrate value to B2B customers.",2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.2,0.17,,,,
,100%,40%,Product strategy,,1.0,"COMPANY B's strength lies within identifying best practices for data management and reporting that cut across industry sectors and making them available broadly across the COMPANY B platform.  COMPANY B  focuses on facilitating workflows across global organizations. We have prioritized the gathering of raw data and transforming it into decision-useful ESG data that can be presented to investors, customers, and other external stakeholders.  We have an aggressive product roadmap that is informed by our subscriber-led innovation workgroups, which are hosted quarterly, with an in-person meeting at our annual customer conference.  
Where we see greater opportunity in the future is building out more capabilities to support ESG-related risk assessments and scenario analysis. We are building out more tools to support physical and transition risk assessments by integrating more forward-looking 3rd party data and quantifying business impacts in different warming scenarios.
For 5+ years, COMPANY B has developed AI technologies to advance the practice of informed decision making via our COMPANY B AI Advisors.  These capabilities have been applied in our EHS and Operational Risk platforms and will be applied in our Sustainability and ESG platform to help organizations synthesize large volumes of information sourced from various business systems, 3rd party providers, and within the COMPANY B solution.  
COMPANY B also plans to expand our decarbonization solutions to give our subscribers deeper insights into how they can approach hard-to-abate emissions. This means analyzing customer's value chains and aligning with CAPEX replacement cycles to identify potential emission reduction potential and building a clearer path forward to acheiving net zero.
We are also developing additional workflows related to ESG disclosure requests for information and looking to leverage blockchain technology to disseminate ESG metrics and disclosures in a secure and immutable format.

,,25%,Internal data acquisition,,2.0,"As standard, the Benchmark platform and ESG Director, specifically, includes a facilitated data collection workflow that includes specified KPI Data Owners that are typically cross-functional in nature with automated email notifications to ensure timely inputs.  Benchmark Benchmark Forms includes a user-configurable data input forms capability allowing subscribers to design their own.  

Benchmark utilizes a wide variety of tools to easily transition data into our system. Our Dashboard & Analytics tools utilizes a DWH that can connect to existing business data warehouse, or businesses can work with us to set up a data warehouse with our hosting datacenter. The Benchmark-hosted Data Warehouse provides unlimited reporting on full data sets and expands ad hoc reporting capabilities (data from additional applications and customized fields) using a non-production data repository and business-specific configuration of de-normalized data sets (fields, labels, etc.).

We also utilize Apache NiFi, a data processing and integration platform, to build internal/external data and integration pipelines. Benchmark Digital has the ability to perform simple ETL, and can be used in batch and stream use caes. It is not just about moving data from A to B, it can do complex (and performant) transformations, enrichments and normalizations. It comes out of the box with support for many specific sources and endpoints (e.g. Kafka, Elastic, HDFS, S3, Postgres, Mongo, etc.) as well as generic sources and endpoints (e.g. TCP, HTTP, IMAP, etc.). ",2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.4,0.25,,,,
,,25%,External data acquisition,,1.0,"The Benchmark team has the capability to export data to a subscriber's own third-party BI tool and has extensive experience with uni-directional and bi-directional integrations as well as user-driven and automated external system integrations. The Benchmark platform facilitates integrations with modern BI platforms through a variety of technologies such as XML, CSV, XLS, TXT data feeds, Web Services, LDAP Query, ODBC/JDBC Connectors, Data Warehouses, and subscriber APIs. Depending on the business requirements, Benchmark has the ability to make real-time integrations or schedule integrations at specific times based on data volume as well as frequency of data records that are updated. Our subscriber services teams work with users to define the frequency based on their needs and expectations.  Benchmark has extensive experience integrating with utility data aggregators such as Capturis, Enel X, Engie, Glynt.AI, NUS, Schneider Electric, Urjanet as well as ERP and HR systems like SAP, Oracle, WorkDay and more.  We can also interface with building management systems, smart meters, and data historians for additional data aquisition.

Benchmark's Data Xchange Portal (DXP), enables subscribers to easily customize data sets, upload, and transform interfaces; upload and transfer data to & from Benchmark modules and business tools, as well as third-party applications; securely access and share data anytime, anywhere online across all devices and users; publish the business’s Data Warehouse for reporting and analytics; and link data sets together no matter their source, allowing for a holistic view of operations.

Benchmark Digital is one of 10 CDP Accredited Service Providers participating in development of a CDP API that will allow for direct submission of CDP questionnaire responses from Benchmark directly into the CDP reporting system.

In addition to the above integrations, portals, and APIs, Benchmark offers self-service batch upload templates, a Survey Engine for collecting stakeholder inputs, as well as a Supplier Portal supported by unique, encrypted URLs that enable supply chain engagement without requiring Suppliers to manage user accounts to the system.

,,25%,API for data integration,,2.0,"Benchmark designed Sustainability Reporting and ESG Director to be a fluid data management system where manual input is avoided whenever possible. At the start of the data collection process, Benchmark integrates with other Benchmark modules with operational ESG data (e.g. Sustainability Reporting, Incidents & Measurements) or other EHSSQ management systems, ERP systems (such as SAP), human capital management systems (such as Workday) via our Data Exchange Portal. Benchmark also can build direct integrations with utility providers, integrate with utility data aggregators (such as Arcadia/Urjanet) or scan invoices using OCR technology provided by GLYNT AI. Conversion and emission factors (from globally recognized sources such as the U.S. EPA, eGRID, IEA, DEFRA, CDP, and more) are stored in our system to standardize data and automatically calculate greenhouse gas emissions. Finalized ESG metrics are then be passed from Sustainability Reporting to ESG Director to complete ESG responses, which can then be submitted via API or SFTP to external sources, such as CDP, with whom Benchmark is one of 10 software providers participating in the CDP's API pilot program, launched in Q2 of 2023.",3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.1,0.41,,,,

This platform hosted on a global public cloud, with mutiple regional options. We utilize a combination of open source and licensed software that are seamlessly integrated and connected on a base platform.  Many subscribers start with a single module and phase in additional modules as their program needs grow, which is as simple as creating a new database to host the data.  The Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model that Benchmark employs enables customers to stay on the cutting edge by eliminating the concept of software versioning.  Each subscriber will always be using the latest enhancements and capabilities of the Benchmark platform. Benchmark application updates/enhancements are released on an on-going basis to bring continual improvements to the user experience and application usability, with configuration and feature extension options that can be turned on/off to meet specific company program and workflow needs.

In data mining reports, numerous filters exist for operational reporting levels, world region, country, and state, as well as custom groupings of facilities (e.g. owned vs. leased, ISO certified, etc.).  Additionally there are data-specific filters (e.g. verification status, record type, etc.) and custom groupings of metrics can be created for fast aggregation across multiple metrics (e.g. Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3).  Project data can be filtered by project type, resources and by savings/cost criteria (e.g. <$10,000 investment; >50 MT CO2e saved).  Disclosures are also mapped to a variety of frameworks (e.g. CDP, TCFD, GRI, SASB, BRSR) and custom frameworks can be created by system administrators and associated with existing or custom KPIs (e.g. internal management systems).",2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.2,0.38,,,,

,,10%,Business rules,,2.0,"Through years of operational experience and deep understanding of industry best practices, Benchmark modules focus on providing intuitive and user-friendly workflow functionality for designated process owners to execute their tasks & responsibilities rather than simply concentrate on program/metrics input. As a result, adoption of our applications is more broadly based across the organization with benefits across all levels up through management thanks to readily generated and up-to-date dashboards. Workflows are specific to any given module and can be customized on implementation if needed as an additional project, although it has very rarely been necessary across our the 400+ companies that use Benchmark solutions.

For example, ESG Administrators can define which topics and KPIs are material to their organization and assign ownership of topics that are material.  Each owner can then decide the best way to collect the data for their responsibility portfolio - some choosing to route questions to their team; some deciding to gather information from business unit or site-level individuals; or by collecting the same information from multiple legal entity leaders.  This provides flexibility over the data collection process on a topic-by-topic and in some cases a KPI-by-KPI basis.

As part of standard offerings, role-based permissions can be easily assigned to the users based on the organizational structure (organization, business units, sites, etcetera).  The system will automatically assign application permissions to individuals designated in these roles to ensure that they have the ability to view/edit data for their location. Role-based access is supported and roles can be established by defining a specific set of viewing and editing rights and applying this group of permissions to a set of users. Furthermore, Sustainability/ESG administrators can define workflow-specific roles and responsibilities, such as ESG Program Administrators, ESG Program Area Managers, and KPI Owners, as well as different types/levels of reviewers.",2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.7,0.24,,,,

Quantitative metrics can be entered in local currency and units of measure and the system will automatically convert the raw data to business-defined roll-up units of measure and currency on reports, enabling primary data to be collected as-is while driving consistency and eliminating calculation errors.  If a unit of measure does not exist in our library we will add it to our library and work with our sustainability experts and consulting partners to ensure that it converts to the appropriate roll-up unit.
